## üîí Permission System

### Role-Based Access Control
```javascript
// lib/permissions.js
export const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: 'admin',
  MEMBER: 'member',
  VIEWER: 'viewer'
};

export const PERMISSIONS = {
  TEAM_DELETE: 'team:delete',
  TEAM_EDIT: 'team:edit',
  TEAM_INVITE: 'team:invite',
  PROJECT_CREATE: 'project:create',
  PROJECT_DELETE: 'project:delete',
  TASK_CREATE: 'task:create',
  TASK_DELETE: 'task:delete',
  TASK_ASSIGN: 'task:assign'
};

const rolePermissions = {
  [ROLES.ADMIN]: [
    PERMISSIONS.TEAM_DELETE,
    PERMISSIONS.TEAM_EDIT,
    PERMISSIONS.TEAM_INVITE,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_DELETE,
    PERMISSIONS.TASK_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.TASK_DELETE,
    PERMISSIONS.TASK_ASSIGN
  ],
  [ROLES.MEMBER]: [
    PERMISSIONS.TEAM_INVITE,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.TASK_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.TASK_ASSIGN
  ],
  [ROLES.VIEWER]: []
};

export function hasPermission(userRole, permission) {
  return rolePermissions[userRole]?.includes(permission) || false;
}

export function requirePermission(userRole, permission) {
  if (!hasPermission(userRole, permission)) {
    throw new Error(`Permission denied: ${permission}`);
  }
}
```
